>>>>Example Group (Allow All)

    -- here we will create an admin group however we do not want them to use the map editor or mess with the permission groups
    Permission_Groups.new_group('Admin') -- this defines a new group called "Admin"
    :allow_all() -- this makes the default to allow any input action unless set other wise
    :disallow{ -- here we disallow the input action we dont want them to use
        'add_permission_group',
        'delete_permission_group',
        'import_permissions_string',
        'map_editor_action',
        'toggle_map_editor'
    }

>>>>Example Group (Disallow All)

    -- here we will create a group that cant do anything but talk in chat
    Permission_Groups.new_group('Restricted') -- this defines a new group called "Restricted"
    :disallow_all() -- this makes the default to disallow any input action unless set other wise
    :allow('write_to_console') -- here we allow them to chat, {} can be used here if we had more than one action
