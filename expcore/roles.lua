--- Factorio role system to manage custom permissions

>>>>Using Role System (Frontend):
    When a map first starts you will want to define on mass all the players you expect to join and the roles to give them:
    Roles.override_player_roles{
        Cooldude2606 = {'Owner','Admin','Member'},
        NotCooldude2606 = {'Member'}
    }

    Once the game is running you still want to be able to give role and remove them which is when you would use:
    Roles.assign_player(player,'Admin',by_player_name) -- this will give the "Admin" role to the player
    Roles.unassign_player(player,{'Admin','Moderator'},by_player_name) -- this will remove "Admin" and "Moderator" role in one go

>>>>Using Role System (Backend):
    To comparer two players you can comparer the index of they highest roles, can be used when you want to allow a "write" down type system:
    Roles.get_player_highest_role(playerOne).index < Roles.get_player_highest_role(playerTwo).index -- remember that less means a higher role

    Listing all of a players roles can also be useful which is when you would want to use:
    Roles.get_player_roles(player) -- the return is an array that can be looped over however this is not in particular order

    Finally you may want to test if a player has a certain role, flag or action allowed which is when you would use:
    Roles.player_has_role(player,'Admin') -- you can provide a role name if you only want a name based system
    Roles.player_has_flag(player,'is_donator') -- your roles can be grouped together with flags such as is_donator
    Roles.player_allowed(player,'game modifiers') -- or you can have an action based system where each action is something the player can do

>>>>Example Flag Define:
    Flags can be used to group multiple roles and actions under one catch all, for example if you want a piece of code to only
    be active for your donators then you would add a "is_donator" flag to all your donator roles and then in the code test if
    a player has that tag present:

    -- give you donators a speed boost when they join; these functions aren't required but can be useful
    Roles.define_flag_trigger('is_donator',function(player,state)
        if state then
            player.character_running_speed_modifier = 1.5
        else
            player.character_running_speed_modifier = 1
        end
    end)

    -- then on all your donator roles you would add
    Roles.new_role('Donator')
    :set_flag('is_donator')

    -- and in your code you would test for
    if Roles.player_has_flag(player,'is_donator') then
        -- some donator only code
    end

>>>>Example Role Define:
    You can't use a role system without any roles so first you must define your roles; each role has a minimum of a name with
    the option for a shorthand:
    Roles.new_role('Administrator','Admin')

    Next you will want to add any extras you want to have, such as a tag, colour, permission group or any custom flags:
    Roles.new_role('Administrator','Admin')
    :set_custom_tag('[Admin]')
    :set_custom_color('red') -- this can be {r=0,g=0,b=0} or a predefined value
    :set_permission_group('Staff') -- a second argument can be added if you have not used the custom permission group config
    :set_flag('is_admin')

    You will then want to decide if you want to allow all actions, this should of course be used sparely:
    Roles.new_role('Administrator','Admin')
    ...extras...
    :set_allow_all()

    If you dont do this want this as i would advise you do then you will want to define what the role can do; this comes with
    an optional inheritance system if you like those sort of things in which case disallow may also be of some use to you:
    Roles.new_role('Administrator','Admin')
    ...extras...
    :set_parent('Moderator') -- the admin can do anything that a moderator can do
    :allow{ -- these actions can be anything just try to keep them without conflicts
        'command/kill',
        'gui/game settings'
    }

    Here is what the finished admin role would look like:
    Roles.new_role('Administrator','Admin')
    :set_custom_tag('[Admin]')
    :set_custom_color('red')
    :set_permission_group('Staff')
    :set_flag('is_admin')
    :set_parent('Moderator')
    :allow{
        'command/kill',
        'gui/game settings'
    }

>>>>Example System Define:
    Once all roles are defined these steps must be done to ensure the system is ready to use, this includes setting a default
    role, assigning a root (all permission) role that the server/system will use and the linier order that the roles fall into:

    Roles.set_default('Guest')
    Roles.set_root('System')

    Roles.define_role_order{
        'System',
        'Administrator',
        'Moderator',
        'Donator',
        'Guest'
    }

    Just remember that in this example all these roles have not been defined; so make sure all your roles that are used are defined
    before hand; a config file on load is useful for this to ensure that its loaded before the first player even joins.
